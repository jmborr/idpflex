    r"""Cluster a set of representative structures by structural similarity
    (RMSD) and by a set of properties

    The simulated trajectory is divided into segments, and hierarchical
    clustering is performed on each segment to yield a limited number of
    representative structures (the centroids). Properties are calculated
    for each centroid, thus each centroid is described by a property
    vector. The dimensionality of the vector is related to the number of
    properties and the dimensionality of each property.
    The distances between any two centroids is calculated as the
    Euclidean distance between their respective vector properties.
    The distance matrix containing distances between all possible
    centroid pairs is employed as the similarity measure to generate
    the hierarchical tree of centroids.

    The properties calculated for the centroids are stored in the
    leaf nodes of the hierarchical tree. Properties are then propagated
    up to the tree's root node.
